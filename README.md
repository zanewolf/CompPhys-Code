# Example-Code
Code created for Course Projects 

This was when I first started to seriously code (four years after the matlab class), and it was my first time ever coding in javascript. Please forgive me for my (many) sins. Not all the codes work. Load them, sometimes funny things will happen. Or don't, because javascript sucks.
