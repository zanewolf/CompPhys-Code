# Example-Code
Code created for Course Projects 

Some code was compiled for the courses and then students adapted it to suit the homework assignment. 
Some is completely original.
Most of it works correctly. 
But all of it has been modified by me at some point. As I upload I will attempt to comment and annotate what is my work 
and what was created by TAs for student use. 

Please contact me with comments or suggestions. There is room for significant improvement, for sure.
