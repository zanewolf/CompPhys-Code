# Example-Code
Code created for Course Projects 

This was when I first started to learn how to code, and it was my first time ever coding in java script. Please forgive me for my (many) sins. 

Some code was compiled for the courses and then students adapted it to suit the homework assignment. 
Some is completely original.
Most of it works correctly.
